# Internet-Car-Radio
Internet radio with a car-friendly UI
There are plenty of Internet Radio apps - but none of them (that I've found) work particularly well on a car head unit.  The only option was to roll my own!

This is a self contained HTML Web App.  You can either download it & run it entirely locally - or use the URL of the file on Github and open it from there.

It has BIG buttons - easy to press when you're driving.
A Dark Theme suitable for use at night.
No adverts, banners and other garbage.
It doesn't spy on you.

If you have Audio Auto-play enabled in your browser settings, it will resume the last station playing on startup.  If connectivity is lost, it will keep retrying until the stream can resume.

It's free to use, modify, share - do what you like with it!
